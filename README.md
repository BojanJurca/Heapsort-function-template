# C++ heapsort function template

C++ heapSort function template sorts elements in the array.
 
Please note that this is not a description of the heap sort algorithm. If you want to understand how the algorithm works, there are plenty of resources on the internet. For example:

   [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-sort)
   
   [https://builtin.com/data-science/heap-sort](https://builtin.com/data-science/heap-sort)

This is just a working function template, in case someone needs it. The emphasis was on the simplicity and ease of use. Trying to put the whole algorithm in a single function required getting rid of the recursive "heapify" function, therefore it was necessary to replicate part of the code.
   
Basically, all you need to do is to include this file in your project and call the heapSort function. Please, see the examples provided here.
